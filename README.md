# uemu — tiny RISC-V system emulator

***uemu*** is a small system emulator that boots real firmware and OS images (OpenSBI, U-Boot, Linux) and runs raw/ELF test binaries. Implemented ISA: **rv64ima_zicsr_zifencei**.

## Boot Demo

## Quick facts

* **Type**: system emulator (physical memory + platform devices).
* **Accepts**: raw binaries and ELF images.
* **GDB**: supported (`--gdb`).
* **Built devices**:

  * DRAM: `0x80000000` — `0x8FFFFFFF` (256MB)
  * CLINT: `0x02000000` — `0x0200FFFF`
  * PLIC: `0x0C000000` — `0x0FFFFFFF`
  * UART16550 (console), Goldfish RTC, goldfish-events, goldfish-battery, SIFIVE TEST, simple-framebuffer.

## Host dependencies

Install these on your host before building:

* `cmake` (≥3.14), `make`, `gcc`/`g++` (build tools)
* `pkg-config`
* `libsdl2-dev` (SDL2 development package)
* `libreadline-dev`, `libncurses-dev`
* `git`
* `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc`, `riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy`, `riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump`
* (Optional) `gdb-multiarch` or other riscv gdb for remote debugging

## Fetch the code

```bash
git clone --depth=1 --recursive https://github.com/snnbyyds/uemu.git
```

## Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

This produces:

* `uemu` (the emulator)
* `run_tests` (GoogleTest host test runner)

Notes:

* The build fetches GoogleTest automatically.
* A small `mini-gdbstub` library is built via the CMake custom target and linked into `uemu`.

## Run examples

Run an image (raw or ELF):

```bash
./uemu path/to/image.bin
```

Run with gdbstub enabled:

```bash
./uemu --gdb path/to/image.elf
# then connect from your RISC-V GDB (example)
riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb path/to/image.elf
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234   # adjust port per your gdbstub config
```

For running OpenSBI and Linux, refer to [Booting Linux on uemu](https://github.com/snnbyyds/uemu/blob/dev/software/README.md) or try out the prebuilt binary in [releases](https://github.com/snnbyyds/uemu/releases).

An incomplete [nexus-am](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/nexus-am) (@OpenXiangShan's fork of The Abstract Machine) port is provided at https://github.com/snnbyyds/nexus-am

For [*Introduction to Computer System*](https://nju-projectn.github.io/ics-pa-gitbook/) students, porting [Abstract Machine](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/abstract-machine) and [Nanos-lite](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/nanos-lite) is an exercise.

## Builtin tests

* Unit / integration tests are bundled into `run_tests` (GoogleTest). Execute:

```bash
# from build/
./run_tests
# or use CTest
ctest
```

## Run riscv-arch-test via RISCOF

For formal architecture testing / regression harnesses, use RISCOF. See the official RISCOF documentation and usage guide:
[https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

### Install RISCOF

```bash
pipx install riscof
```

### Reference model (REF)

This setup uses the **RISC-V Sail Model 0.7**: [https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/tree/0.7](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/tree/0.7)
Build the Sail model per its README and add the resulting binaries to `$PATH`.

### Generate `config.ini`

```bash
cd verif
./generate_config.py
```

### Run tests

```bash
riscof run --config=config.ini --suite=../riscv-arch-test/riscv-test-suite/ --env=../riscv-arch-test/riscv-test-suite/env
```

## Notes

* **uemu** implements **rv64ima_zicsr_zifencei** only. Images built for other extensions may fail or trap.

* **riscv-arch-test** submodule has been set to our own fork due to GitHub issue [LA macro generates compressed instructions for platform that does not support C extension #659](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test/issues/659)

## TODO

Due to the limitation of the author's ability, 
planned and ongoing work for future versions of **uemu** includes:

* **Full RV64GC support** — implement compressed (`C`), atomic (`A`), floating-point (`F/D`), and other missing extensions.
* **JIT compilation** — introduce a lightweight dynamic translation layer for improved performance.
* **Full keyboard and mouse support**
* **Comprehensive disk and storage support** — implement block devices (e.g., virtio-blk or simple IDE) for persistent storage.

Contributions, testing, and feedback are welcome to help bring these features to completion.
